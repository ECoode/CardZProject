The Basics:
------------
Battle is turn based and in campaign you go against the computer.
You will get five cards for your use and when it's your turn you can choose one of them to the battle arena.
If you got cards on the battle arena you have to choose from Attacking enemy or Adding new card to arena.
There will be maxium of cards in the battle area, but it can increase by level or even with spells(?)
You can not harm the MAIN enemy (player) if there's creatures in the arena, except if you got a special card.

The Special Cards:
------------------
There will be special cards, which makes game more interesting and fun.
Special cards are rare but they affect the gameplay (enemies) huge! They can have example HUGE DAMAGE.
What comes to gameplay, special cards are not just 'click' and 'attack'. 
You will have to make custom rune figures by writing it with your mouse!
If you're fast enough and the drawing is fine The Cast Meter rises.

The Nation Combo:
------------------
As we know; You can choose at the registering part from three different nations to belong into.
When you use same nations cards in a row you will earn Nation Combo.
The Nation Combo makes your Cast Meter to rise.

The Cast Meter:
----------------
The Cast Meter is meter which measures your combo and special card power.
It rises everytime you success casting The Special Card and get good Nation Combo.
When The Cast Meter gets full (100%), you get BONUS.
